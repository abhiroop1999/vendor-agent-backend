Of course. A good README is essential for any project. Based on our entire conversation and the final state of your application, here is a comprehensive README file.

You can copy and paste the text below into a new file named README.md in the root directory of your project.

Vendor Agent: AI-Powered Supplier Discovery
Vendor Agent is an intelligent backend service designed to help businesses find and evaluate suppliers. By providing a product, quantity, and location, the agent leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze and score potential vendors, simplifying the procurement process.

How It Works
Imagine you need to source a specific product for your business. Instead of manually searching and vetting suppliers, you can send a single request to the Vendor Agent. The agent will:

Receive your request for a specific product.

Consult a list of potential suppliers.

Use the Google Gemini AI to analyze each supplier's suitability based on your request.

Return a clean, scored list of vendors, ranked by their relevance.

Key Features
AI-Powered Scoring: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for intelligent, context-aware supplier evaluation.

Simple JSON API: Built with FastAPI, providing a clean and modern RESTful interface.

Mock Supplier Data: Uses a mock list of vendors for demonstration, which can be easily replaced with a real database.

Cloud-Ready Deployment: Configured for easy deployment on platforms like Railway using Docker.

Secure API Key Management: Loads the required GOOGLE_API_KEY from environment variables for security.

Technology Stack
Backend: Python

Framework: FastAPI

Web Server: Uvicorn

AI Model: Google Gemini Pro

Deployment: Docker, Railway

API Usage
Send a POST request to the /vendor-agent endpoint with a JSON body containing the product, quantity, and location.
